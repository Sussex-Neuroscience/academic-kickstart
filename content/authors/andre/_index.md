Iâ€™m passionate about open science and open source hardware, and how those two can be used to increase science and educations reach all over. I have a background in Neurosciences and have been developing affordable open science hardware and teaching others to do so via workshops, talks and outreach events.

I started Open Neuroscience , and volunteer at Trend in Africa as an open source adviser and by organizing and running Open Labware workshops.

Currently I work at the Department of Neurosciences in the University of Sussex, where I develop equipment to support research labs.
