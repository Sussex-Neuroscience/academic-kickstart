​
Currently I study chromatic and colour vision in zebrafish in the laboratory of Tom Baden. My background is psychophysics and electrophysiology.  
  
​
Within the lab, everyone specialises a bit. I find myself coding and analysing data in front of a PC more often than at the setup.  
  
​
On the side, I am interested in causal models and causal reasoning; both in philosophy of science and in computing.
