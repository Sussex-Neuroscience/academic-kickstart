I am currently studying retinal circuits underlying colour vision processing at the university of Sussex.  
  
I started designing Open Hardware equipment to develop new protocol for our neuroscience lab, which overtime became an important part of my research work.  
  
Now, I am looking to develop more Open Source tools and equipement that could benefit our peers' research in academia and improve scientific access in education.
